Apple's Getting Started iOS

Although well versed in application development on iOS using Objective-C, I needed this tutorial to assist on how to implement in Swift.

I had done alot of reading on Swift and tried various sample apps, but this one was a real eye opener and let me know how Apple expects things to be done.  The implicitly unwrapped optionals for UI outlets, failable initializers, target action in Swift and TableViews.

Simply performing the tutorial was very educational, and gave me more confidence in my swift abilities.
